		I see you standing among them all    	 	  	      	 	  
		  	       	      	   	   	    	  	     	     	       
		Standing so strong ,proud and tall      	   	     	       	    
		  	      	     	 	  	   	  	     	      	      
		The world looks at you, but does not see       	   	    	      	      
		   	   	    	  	     	     	 	    	    
		Everything you sacrifice to keep us free	  	       	       	 
		     	       	       	      	      	   	       	     	       	       
		I'm here to say, to let you know    	      		     	 	 
			  		 	     	    	   	       	  
		That you are loved, even if it doesn't show

		You fight for our hopes,dreams,and liberty

		You fight for our freedom

		A hero to be

		We want you to know, your never alone

		For we are waiting, for you to come home

		But the hardest thing for a person to be is you

		A soldier, fighting to keep us free.
